### Project name
>Maker DAO Adapter
### Team members 
> Cristian Perez Ramirez
### Project Overview
> I will build an adapter for the Maker DAO price oracles  that enables users to create conditional markets based on them. I will do this by implementing Solidity interfaces that will read the oracles and a smart contract that enables the creation of conditional tokens based on price predictions via the Gnosis conditional token explorer and factory.  The Maker DAO medianizer ETH price oracle is free to use. Other price oracles require a request to governance to be whitelisted. I have already begun this process. Motivation for this project is to familiarize myself with the Gnosis protocol and conditional tokens while building a useful application that provides high resolution information about Ethereum token prices. I find the concept of prediction markets very intruiguing and see much potential for use cases. I Estimate this project will take 2-3 weeks to complete.

### Funding
> In accordance with the time estimate of the project and the guidelines published in the Gitcoin bounty I am requesting 2,000 USD of funding. If work is started Monday, October 12 it will be complete by the 26th or the end of the month at the latest.
